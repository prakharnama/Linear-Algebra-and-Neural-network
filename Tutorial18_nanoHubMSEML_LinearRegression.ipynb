Data will be obtained from [Pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org/) and [Mendeleev](https://mendeleev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n",

In this first snippet of code we will import all relevant libraries, the elements that will be turned into cases and the properties that will serve as the attributes for the cases. The elements listed were chosen because they represent the three most common crystallographic structures, and also querying them for properties yields a dataset with no unknown values."
