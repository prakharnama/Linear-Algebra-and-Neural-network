# Linear-Algebra-and-Neural-network
This repository contains some problems which will teach you how to go forward with learning neural network from scratch i.e. starting from linear algebra to applying neural network on a crystal structure dataset


## Details

This is a branch created in which I have solved some of the problems related to the tutorial.
I have to update the assignment. Do Check the tutorials first.
