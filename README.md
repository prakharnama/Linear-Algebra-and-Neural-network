# Linear-Algebra-and-Neural-network
This repository contains some problems which will teach you how to go forward with learning neural network from scratch i.e. starting from linear algebra to applying neural network on a crystal structure dataset

## Libraries 
If you are using the jupyter notebook, these are some of the libraries you need to install for the tutorials from 17 to 20. These tutorial are taken from the [nanohub](https://nanohub.org/tools/mseml). This site contains various projects related to material science. Do check it out.

'''bash
import pymatgen as pymat
import mendeleev as mendel
import tensorflow
import keras
'''

<b> Note: For windows, you need to install latest visual studio as some of the tools may not load.</b>
As you may know that keras are now a part of tensorflow, but these notebook are made before the keras are used as individual library, so do check out the tensorflow documentation. However, it still works in my modified notebook

## Description
The description of each tutorial is given as Tutorial{number}_{what it contains}.

1. Starting from the Tutorial 1 upto the tutorial 7, you will have a basic understanding of how to work with tools like Linear algebra, plotting, variance, SVD and PCA analysis which are crucial aspects for creating a model.
2. Tutorial 8 is a small tutorial that will teach you, how to install pymatgen in your PC or laptop. 

3. Tutorial 9 upto the tutorial 13 gives you an detailed view of the how to use probability distribution, Linear regression from scratch, Gradient descent from scratch, Logistic regression and Kmeans clustering. These notebooks are highly detailed if you are a begineer do take you time understanding them.
4. Tutorial 14 is a detailed overview of the how to create a neural network model using the tensorflow library so check the file attached with to load the dataset.
5. Tutorial 15 and 16 are the latest ways to solve a ordinary differential equation in python.
6. Tutorial 17 to Tutorial 20 are taken taken from the Nano hub as mentioned above. These tutorials are modified to describe the various aspects of the Neural network model.
So, you are free to uncomment some of the text and run to code to check out how the activation function, optimizers and no. of neurons affects the overall model.
